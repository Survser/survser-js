# Survser NPM Wrapper

This is the official NPM wrapper for integrating Survser with your application.

The Survser NPM package seamlessly integrates the Survser JavaScript client into your application. It provides a wrapper object that encapsulates all client methods. Method calls are queued and executed once the Survser JavaScript client is fully ready to go.
